Interactive GUI application to visualize the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm.
Allows users to input two custom strings.
Dynamically builds the DP table cell-by-cell with animation.
Uses Dynamic Programming to compute the LCS efficiently.
Visualizes the (len(str1)+1) × (len(str2)+1) DP grid.
Highlights the backtracking path used to construct the LCS.
Displays the final LCS string and its length.
Implements event-driven architecture using Pygame.
Includes proper state management (Input → Build → Backtrack → Result).
Provides Restart functionality to reset the game safely.
Includes Quit option to exit the application.
Demonstrates understanding of DP recurrence relations.
Combines algorithmic logic with GUI development.
Useful as an educational visualization tool for learning DP concepts.
Showcases applied Data Structures & Algorithms in a real project.
